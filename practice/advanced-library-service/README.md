Problems with naming, long methods, comments, formatting, responsibilities, code smells.

"Clean Code" is code that is easy to read and understand.

We've been getting some hints about how to improve code quality in provided Catalog, Library, and DataServices 
classes. Take a look at those classes and their tests. Can you easily, from first glance understand what is going on
in that code? If so, go ahead and take the rest of the day off :).

If not, then you're like most people. In this case, please open
your favourite IDE and spend some time cleaning up this
code by improving the names, methods, responsibilities, smells that you find.
Remember that a Long Method is not judged by how many lines of code,
but rather whether or not it is doing more than one thing.

Make sure you review the Mock objects as well.

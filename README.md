Practice tasks are slitted into multiple groups:
- basic
- middle
- advanced


# Basic part
Tasks are to refactor everything you think looks strange/unclear/has code smells, according to main clean code 
principles
. During refactoring take attention 
to 
- naming
- functions
- comments
- formatting
- classes and objects 
- error handling


# Advanced

you will go according
clean code related principles, practices and refactoring techniques. Anti patterns used in 
project should be avoided and changed to best practices usage.
